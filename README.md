# Turnify

Experience spotify as a boomer.

## About this project

This project aims to create an alternative Spotify player that forces you to listen to music instead of consume it.

You will have to select an album and listen as an LP, this means:
 
 * You listen to approximately 20 minutes of music and then the playback stops.
 * Either you flip the vinyl and listen to the other side, or you switch to another LP.
 * There is no playlists.
 * There is no algorithmic music suggestion.
 * You can save LP in your digital collection.

## Project status

This is in a very basic state, you will be able to search albums and play them, but this is a still in progress application.

* [x] Search albums
* [x] Start playback of an album
* [x] Show album songs
* [ ] Divide album songs by LP sides
* [ ] Stop playback when reaching the end of the LP side
* [ ] Limit search results to actual LPs
* [ ] Implement search pagination
* [ ] Make the UI pretty
* [ ] Make song seeking imprecise

Things that I would like to add, but probably violate Spotify terms of use, so I need to ask permission first:

* [ ] Emulate vinyl crackle
* [ ] Prepend a few seconds of "vinyl silence" before starting playback when an album is selected or LP side is switched.
* [ ] Append a few seconds of "vinyl silence" at the end of an LP side.
  > Do not permit any device or system to segue, mix, re-mix, or overlap any Spotify Content with any other audio content (including other Spotify Content).
  >

* [ ] Show a picture of the LP spinning, they can be found on Internet Archive.
  > Do not synchronize any sound recordings with any visual media, including any advertising, film, television program, slideshow, video, or similar content.
  > 
  > Do not create any product or service which is integrated with streams or content from another service.

## Before publishing the App

* [ ] Comply with all spotify developer policy
  * [ ] Create a privacy policy page
  * [ ] Provide a way to disconnect spotify account form the application
  * [ ] Show Spotiy logo somewhere 
    > If you display any Spotify Content you must clearly attribute the content as being supplied and made available by Spotify, by using the Spotify Marks. Our Branding Guidelines include some examples of what you should and shouldnâ€™t do.
