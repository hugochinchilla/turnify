# Turnify

Experience spotify as a boomer.

## About this project

This project aims to create an alternative Spotify player that forces you to listen to music instead of consume it.

You will have to select an album and listen as an LP, this means:
 
 * You listen to approximately 20 minutes of music and then the playback stops.
 * Either you flip the vinyl and listen to the other side, or you switch to another LP.
 * There is no playlists.
 * There is no algorithmic music suggestion.
 * You can save LP in your digital collection.

## Project status
